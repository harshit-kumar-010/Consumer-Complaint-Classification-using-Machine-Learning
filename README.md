# Consumer Complaint Classification

## Overview

Consumer Complaint Classification involves classifying the nature of complaints reported by consumers, typically using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and multiclass classification algorithms. This project aims to address the challenge faced by consumer care departments in efficiently managing large volumes of complaints by automatically categorizing them based on their nature.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and includes the following features:

- **Date received:** The date on which the complaint was received

- **Product**: Type of product associated with the complaint

- **Sub-product**: Type of sub-product associated with the complaint

- **Issue**: The primary issue reported by the consumer

- **Sub-issue**: The secondary issue reported by the consumer

- **Consumer complaint narrative**: Complete description of the complaint reported by the consumer

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify consumer complaints into relevant categories based on the nature of the issue reported. By accurately categorizing complaints, consumer care departments can prioritize and address the most critical issues promptly, thus improving customer satisfaction and retention.
